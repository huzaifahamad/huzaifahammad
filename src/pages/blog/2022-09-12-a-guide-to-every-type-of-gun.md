title: A Guide to Every Type of Gun

  Guns are a part of American life; they’re woven into our history from the time
  matchlock muskets armed the earliest colonies, to the Colt revolvers and
  Winchester rifles of the Old West, to the Glock handgun of today.
  Unfortunately, it seems as more time passes, gun literacy declines. We shoot
  more. We know less. This leads to increased gun violence and fear.


  I’ve built several of my own rifles, enjoy shooting and tinkering with other types of guns, and have handled almost every major gun type built in the last 500 years. In order to better understand firearms, we’ve created this guide to how guns work, where we look at the weapon as a tool and study its history in addition to how different types function.

## How Guns Work

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) defines a firearm as “any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” In other words: if you have a tube and a projectile, and the projectile is designed to fly out of the tube as the result of an explosion, you have a firearm. This is a broad definition that covers everything from potato guns to fully automatic machine guns, but it provides the basic definition of what a gun is and how it works.

The simplest form of firearm today, a bolt-action rifle, is fired by manually pushing forward a bolt, pulling the trigger, pulling back the bolt to release the empty cartridge, and pushing the bolt forward again to load a fresh cartridge. Because of their manual nature, bolt-action guns are accurate but slow to fire. Bolt-action rifles hold between four and ten bullets in an internal or detachable magazine. Examples of a bolt-action rifle include the Remington 700 and Howa 1500. 

## Semi-automatic rifles

These weapons can vary greatly, but the common feature is that every pull of the trigger releases one bullet, and loading a new round is automatic. These guns are sometimes called “automatic” weapons, but in this case that term refers to the loading, not the firing.

The automatic loading process usually involves recycling some of the gun’s gunpowder gases or momentum and using it to eject the empty cartridge and load a new one. Many semi-automatic rifles have external magazines holding five to 30 rounds, which can be changed quickly to reload the weapon.

Examples of semi-automatics include the AR-15 and Browning BAR rifles. (Notice the difference in appearance of both.)
